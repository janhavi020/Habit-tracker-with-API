**Description:**
This Python application utilizes the Nutritionix API to create a personalized fitness tracker. 
Users can input their exercise routines, specifying details like exercise type and duration. 
Leveraging user-provided metrics such as gender, weight, height, and age, the app calculates calorie 
expenditure for each activity. The data is then logged into a spreadsheet using Google Sheets API, 
enabling users to track their fitness progress over time. This intuitive tool empowers individuals to 
monitor their exercise habits, making informed decisions to achieve their fitness goals efficiently.
